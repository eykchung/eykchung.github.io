myangle: "**What is the Angle?**\n\nIn order to consolidate the idea of the modular pillbox, my group incorporated the use of Ratto’s three stages of critical making (253) and McGlashan’s enhancements for creative ideation (378).  We first went over various existing pillbox examples, then critiqued and innovated new redesigns involving those evaluations.  During the redesigning, we often applied rapid and detailed sketching (McGlashan 378)  or used transitional objects (Ratto 254) in order to pantomime the different functions we wanted the pillbox to have.  Often, it was difficult for everyone to fully comprehend the ideas each person within the group had, though eventually, we were able to consolidate the various features that we thought effective towards the user experience of the pillbox.\r\n\n\n\n<br>\nWorks Cited\r\n\n<blockquote>McGlashan, Ann. \"A Pedagogic Approach to Enhance Creative Ideation in  Classroom Practice.\" Springer Science + Business Media Dordecht, 2017.

Above is a little glimpse into an assignment where the redesigning of a box was involved.  What I mean by the redesigning of a box is of the redesigning of the use and purpose of a box.  Some of the criteria included was that the redesign had to made of recycled materials, be accessible, ergonomic, creative, and functionable.

Ideally, the pillbox would function much like an advent calendar.  It would be light and compact enough so users would have the choice to hang it wherever they would like in-home.  The box’s face would be like a whiteboard calendar while having enough surface area to be further personalized (ie. via decorating).  The compartments within the pillbox would be modular: so users would be able to detach the calendar compartments then link the individual segments together.  Lastly, the pillbox would be Bluetooth enabled and linked to a tracker app on the user’s phone,  allowing them to unlock/lock each calendar compartment while tracking their medication intake to prevent overdose.
