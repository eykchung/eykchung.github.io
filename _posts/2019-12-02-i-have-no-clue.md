  **What is the Angle?**


  Angle this time is figuring out how to get the mechanisms (mainly the door
  popping open and the pill boxes to link up together) working.  We're mainly
  using cardboard, though we're also using phones and a telephone connection in
  order to demonstrate the bluetooth/wifi connection the prototype would have in
  order to enable the alarm function.  Magnets, velcro and the recycling of old
  clicker pens will also be involved when  building the prototype.  Lastly,
  we're going to be researching some articles in order to help us flesh out the
  whole idea of cultivating a behavior that involves the encouragement for daily
  medicine intake and regulation.

This is in anticipation for what the second iteration of the project will look like.  My group and I are planning on fleshing out the prototype further via an app prototype rendered in Adobe XD and extra mechanisms in order to get the more physical side of the box brought to life.
