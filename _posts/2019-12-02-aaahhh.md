  <br>What is the <Strong>Angle</strong>?


  As for this section:


  \-research that was done?


  \-materials that were used


  \-acute math since we are talking about angles here (only occasionally, too
  much would be overkill of the point)


  \-Additional thoughts and aspirations


  \-Will the project be continued?

This section should include:
- a brief description of what was done and how
- What were some of the functions of the thing that was created
- A pun about the project in question
