  THIS IS MY ANGLE


  I really hope this also appears.  I need to find out what makes this part tick
  and what the title the hyperlink uses in order to get this to work..  From
  what it seems with the publishing feature that's appearing in the right hand
  side, it looks exactly like the main text above.  The most it seems is like
  another paragraph.  Suppose I can toggle around with the css for this..?

No image this time, just a plain entry to just get a feel as to what's going on with the entry stuff.  Honestly though, trying to get this site up and running is a little beyond my expertise.  I've been trying to get the toggle working for the past couple of hours and nada.  That said, there's still the styling I have to do with CSS, and I'm just right now drowning in code- trying to get a sense of my bearings and whatnot.  That said, let's see how this turns out..
