  **As For An Angle?**


  I really don't have one...  I'm just aiming to get this done and do my best
  while within the time limit I've been given.  I'm definitely going to be
  revisiting to get more stuff done after the end date though for now, what's
  listed above will have to do.  I'm also going to be getting this all done with
  some help from bootswatch, bootstrap, numerous youtube coding videos (thank
  you Julio Codes), my textbook, my lecture slides, and lots of tea.  That said,
  I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get this thing done since,
  evidently from the first few tries I've had to get some changes onto this
  site, there was a lot of fumbling and mess ups with the code.  Here's to
  hoping.

Above is a goal I am working towards: programming this site.  This is the first large thing that will be showcased within my portfolio since this site itself will be the portfolio.  The site will be coded using html and css.  I honestly have no clue what I'm doing and am fiddling around to get stuff to work to the best of my abilities (which is near nonexistent since this is my first time coding anything ever).

So here's what I'm aiming to get done:

\-get the hyperlinks up and running so you can jump into different sections of the page

\-get the toggle bar to work

\-get a couple example entries up on here (such as this one)

\-get a proper layout set up for my site in general

\-keep my cool.. hopefully
